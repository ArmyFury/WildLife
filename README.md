# A recreation of the [WildLife](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU2851hDb3SHoR1-ABT15P2-LhWEM71MJ) series by [Grian](https://www.youtube.com/@Grian)!

Note: For now, there is no plan to add superpowers wildcard as it is complex and will require mods

# Usage

## Compatibility: Works with 1.21.3+

## Commands:

```mcfunction

/wildlifeinfo # Gives info about the plugin

/wildcard # Activates a random wildcard

/wildcardc <wildcard> # Activates a specific wildcard

/wildlife <start|stop|continue> # Starts, stops or continues the series (health counters)

```

Currently available wildcards are -
- Height_Modifier (from ep 1)
- Food_Randomizer (from ep 2)
- Deadly_Snails (from ep 3)
- Fast_Runner (from ep 4)
- Trivia_Bot (from ep 5)
- Random_Mobs (from ep 6)


/wildlife start starts the series, basically giving each player 6 lives

/wildlife continue loads lives from previous session (saved when server stops or /wildlife stop is run)

/wildlife stop stops the life counter and any current wildcard
